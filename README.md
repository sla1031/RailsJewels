# RailsJewels

#Goal
# Create a web application that allows for a jewelry store to sell collections of jewelry using Ruby on Rails.

# A collection of jewelry is some number of gems. A gem has a picture, description, and price. You should use Ruby on Rails scaffolding to create the models, controllers, and views necessary for your web application.

# Once you have collections of jewelry working, create a store that contains multiple collections of jewelry. Also, a store will have a name and contact information.

# Additionally, create a home page for the jewelry store that will display its name, contact information, and its collections of jewels. The layout is up to you. You should include a buy and sell button for each jewel (that will update the database) and will display whether or not the item is sold or available.
